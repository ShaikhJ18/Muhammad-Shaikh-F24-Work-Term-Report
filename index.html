                Hi there! My name is Muhammad Shaikh. During the fall semester of 2024 (September to December), I worked remotely as a Software Engineer for DataInn Inc., a company that builds SaaS-based solutions for businesses. I contributed to SimpleAccounts, a SaaS platform designed to help businesses manage their accounting needs. My work focused on resolving critical bugs, developing new features, and optimizing the performance of the application. I collaborated with a distributed team using Microsoft Teams and other tools, ensuring a seamless workflow and a consistent approach to development. This experience helped me grow both technically and professionally, particularly by working with React.js, Redux, SASS, Node.js, and Spring Boot 3.

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 italic text-center">Goals</h2>
            <p class="mt-4 text-lg">
              <strong>  Learning Goal 1: <br>Master Frontend Development with React.js </strong><br>

To enhance my frontend skills, I worked on building new features using React.js and Formik. I also reviewed and refactored existing React components to improve performance and maintainability. Additionally, I pair-programmed with colleagues to share knowledge and adopt best practices.


I successfully implemented a feature that received positive feedback during code reviews. I also documented the improvements I made in terms of code quality and performance.


Through this goal, I worked extensively with React.js, Node.js, SASS, Formik, and other frontend libraries. I resolved several critical frontend bugs and optimized React components, improving both the user experience and the performance of the application. I also learned valuable best practices for component architecture, state management, and data handling. This goal greatly improved my confidence in working with React and related tools.

<br><br><strong>Learning Goal 2: <br>Enhance Backend Development Skills with Spring Boot and Java </strong><br>

I contributed to backend services by working on RESTful APIs using Spring Boot. I collaborated with the backend team to understand the architecture and participated in code reviews to find optimization opportunities.


I successfully deployed a RESTful API that met project requirements, and I received constructive feedback from team members on my contributions.


While I didn’t focus as much on Java development as initially planned, I gained valuable exposure to backend services, specifically through Spring Boot 3. I worked on API data handling, which improved my understanding of how frontend and backend systems integrate. Although my experience with Java was more limited, I’m looking forward to further developing my backend skills in the future.

<br><br><strong>Learning Goal 3: <br> Improve Git and GitHub Proficiency </strong><br>

I used Git regularly for version control, practicing branching, merging, and resolving conflicts. I also contributed to code reviews on GitHub, providing feedback to peers and improving my collaboration skills.


I successfully managed feature branches from creation to merge with minimal conflicts and received positive feedback on my code review contributions.


I made significant progress with Git and GitHub throughout my term. I became proficient in managing branches, merging code, and handling pull requests (PRs). I actively participated in code reviews, providing constructive feedback and integrating suggestions into my own work. This experience strengthened my collaboration skills and made me much more comfortable using Git in a professional development environment.

<br><br><strong>Learning Goal 4: <br> Understand the Accounting Domain and the SaaS Product </strong><br>

To better understand the product and the industry, I virtually attended business meetings and product demos. I engaged with accounting experts within the company and analyzed key features of our platform to understand how they addressed customer needs.


I could confidently explain accounting-related processes and how our software supports customers. I actively contributed valuable insights during product discussions.


I achieved my goal of understanding the accounting domain and the SaaS product by working closely with the software and engaging with accounting experts. I gained a deep understanding of core financial processes such as balance sheets, journals, and credit/debit notes. This allowed me to contribute effectively to product discussions and improve the software’s features. I now feel confident explaining complex accounting concepts and how our platform serves business needs.

<br><br><strong>Learning Goal 5: <br>Enhance Team Communication and Collaboration Skills</strong><br>
I actively participated in team meetings, shared regular updates, and helped address challenges. I also scheduled weekly check-ins with teammates and practiced giving and receiving constructive feedback.


I received positive feedback on my communication and collaboration efforts. I also successfully led a team meeting, demonstrating my improved communication skills.


This goal was one of the most rewarding. I worked hard to maintain clear and open communication with my team, regularly providing updates and engaging in meaningful discussions. I made a conscious effort to foster collaboration by participating in cross-functional team meetings and ensuring alignment between different teams. I became more comfortable with giving and receiving feedback, which improved my ability to work in a team setting. This experience significantly enhanced my communication skills and my ability to collaborate effectively.

            <p class="mt-4 text-lg">
                My role as a Software Engineer involved a combination of frontend and backend development. I worked with technologies such as React, Redux, SASS, Node.js, and Spring Boot 3. Some of the tasks I worked on included fixing critical bugs, implementing new features, and optimizing the performance of the application.

                Some critical bugs that I fixed included form validation to ensure that the data being entered was correctly formatted and sanitized. Additionally, I added features to allow users to export financial data and download reports as CSV files.

                This role required a mix of JavaScript, React, Node.js, and Spring Boot skills, as well as the ability to collaborate effectively in a remote environment. I worked closely with other developers, participated in code reviews, and contributed to sprint planning.
